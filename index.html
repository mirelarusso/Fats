			<p>Everybody knows already about good fats (raw oils and fats from fruits, grains, seeds) and bad fats (from animals or even the good oil processed: fried or cooked). Fat seems to be used for energy longer than carbohydrates before being stored by the body. This is because fats delay digestion- may take up to four to six hours. The need for fat is small, and the best sources are raw whole foods like nuts and avocados. All other fats are poison for your body. </p>

			<p>I don't recommend to combine fats with proteins or fresh fruits. We all know how tasty is "guacamole". We have a combination of fats with fruits (which are tomatoes) so when we eat it, the stomach will be "confused" because of the fresh tomato which need 20-30 minutes for digestion and a fat which needs more than 4 hours. If we have also the oil and salt, garlic, and if we spread it on a slice of bread, we already have a little situation here. Well, nobody say "don't eat guacamole anymore because of bad combination", you are free to eat anything you like but you should think about it. I recommend not more than 2-3 avocados by week. It is wrong to believe that the body needs fats to survive, or let's say this is often overlooked. Obese people they don't understand that their hipoglycemia between the meals is because of inherent need for infrequent meals. They fail to recognize that their symptoms are manifestations of impaired organ functioning, enervation and toxemia. What they require is not more food, especially fat food, but more rest. In my opinion, we all should reduce fats and eat more fruits, let's say 1 spoon of fats/day is enough but you may appreciate which are your needs. In fact, I eat the salad with no spices (oil or salt) and maybe only one each 2-3 weeks.</p>

            <p>I will never speak here about cooked foods because they deranges and destroy nutrients which become unusable substances that are toxic for the body so the leukocytes will doubling or tripling to fight the "enemies". That is why people have low immunity. In conclusion, we need fats and proteins only raw and in small amounts. Larger amounts are a toxic burden, tax our digestive systems and use up too much vital energy. The fat dripping into the fire changes the chemical properties of the fat and the benzopyrene (a cancer-producing agent) goes up in the smoke from the charcoal and coats the steaks.
                About raw fats and proteins, we need them only in small amounts. Spices and condiments have a poison content so they are used only as medicines, humans can not live only on these. </p>
            <p>The rejected minerals which the body cannot use often combine with cholesterol and other fatty substances to form plaque. These block the arteries. The rejected minerals are also likely to be put aside in the body in spaces that exist. Notably is this so in the cranial cavity where the spaces of lost brain cells are filled in by minerals, thus leading to ossification of the brain. This is a cause of senility.
                
                High consumption levels of fat and protein, refined foods and tobacco increase the need for B-12, while at the same time interfering with the synthesis and absorption of B-12. Thus the conventional meat-eater may indeed be a more likely candidate for Vitamin B-12 deficiency and pernicious anemia than the individual on an adequate vegetarian diet.  	 	 		
                It is extremely difficult for meat eaters to maintain a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, high in carbohydrates and fiber, and containing adequate calcium to compensate for the effects of meat in increasing excretion and transfer of calcium.</p>
                <p>Bad combination of fats are nuts and seeds with:
                    *sweet dry fruits
                    *fresh fruits or vegetables
                    *other fats (like avocado which is a fresh fat fruit)
                    If you will combine all the above your body will suffer from too much fatigue so you will have slow elimination and that is why after some kind of diets people never lose weight, but is not only about the weight but also about your organs, they will be less irrigated, because the blood will go to digestion.
                    
                    Have a raw and simple life, love and breathe as we are destined from our mother Nature.
